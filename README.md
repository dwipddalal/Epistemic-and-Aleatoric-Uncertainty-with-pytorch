# Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty
### Epistemic Uncertainty
This form of uncertainty is caused by a lack of understanding of the system. It denotes a lack of understanding of fundamental events. Epistemic uncertainty will diminish with enough training data. In places where there are fewer samples for training, epistemic doubt can occur.
### Aleatoric Uncertainty
The uncertainty that arises from the natural stochasticity of observations is known as aleatoric uncertainty. Even if more data is provided, aleatoric uncertainty cannot be minimised. We call measurement-related uncertainty homoscedastic uncertainty because it is constant across all samples. Heteroscedastic uncertainty refers to input data-dependent uncertainty.
